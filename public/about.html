        Hello again! It's me here letting you get to know me a little bit more!
        ðŸ˜‰
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a fullstack web developer with professional experience in UI/UX,
        HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL and NoSQL. I work using a mix of
        design tools, frameworks and libraries for both personal and clients'
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not clattering away on mechanical keyboards to make magic in
        front of and on small and large screens, I exist in an entirely
        different "normal" world. In that world, I spend time reading/writing,
        catching up with relevant gists, following important news, watching
        movies, making music and spending time with family and occasionally,
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not "full stacking", I'm either creating/designing digital
        products, teaching humans how to learn to code, sharing knowledge and
        experiences, or just living life the best I can.
      </p>
      <p>I'm also a tech content creator and teacher on YouTube and Udemy.</p>
      <p>
        I go for early morning or late night brisk walks, and engage in indoor
        workout/exercises as frequently as I can keep up with.ðŸ˜’
